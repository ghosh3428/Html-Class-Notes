    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>NIIT was established in 1981 by Rajendra S. Pawar and Vijay K. Thadani, graduates from IIT[4] Delhi, with one
        million rupees. NIIT conceived a franchising model in IT education for the very first time, setting up nine
        centers by 1987.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1986, NIIT began its foray into the software domain, beginning with Software Product Distribution under the
        'Insoft' brand.[5] The company also began offering advice and consultancy to large corporations on how to
        leverage technology and make optimum use of their IT investments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1988, NIIT introduced many marketing and advertising strategies for the Indian market including the
        'Computerdrome' in 1990.[6] Another initiative launched by NIIT, was its Bhavishya Jyoti Scholarships program,
        launched in 1991,[7] which was targeted at deserving and socially challenged students with an aim to improve
        their skills and employability quotient.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1992, NIIT launched its flagship program GNIIT, an industry-endorsed course with a 12-month Professional
        Practice for students seeking careers in the IT and non-IT sectors. By 1993, the NIIT stock began trading on
        Indian stock exchanges. In 1996, NIIT began its globalization journey, setting up an education center in Hong
        Kong. In the same year, the company launched its virtual university 'NetVarsity'. In 1998, NIIT joined a handful
        of Indian tech companies to enter the Chinese market. The company earned the epithet, the 'McDonald's of the
        software business' by Far Eastern Economic Review in September, 2001.[8] The same year, NIIT launched an
        experiment that was christened 'Hole-in-the-Wall' by media and drew international attention. The experiment was
        based on the ‘minimally invasive education’ methodology developed by NIIT R&D. It suggested that children,
        irrespective of their social, ethnic, or educational identity could learn to use computers by themselves,
        without adult intervention. In 2003, NIIT launched its MindChampions Academy (MCA) with Viswanathan Anand,
        five-time former World Chess champion and NIIT Brand Ambassador.</p>

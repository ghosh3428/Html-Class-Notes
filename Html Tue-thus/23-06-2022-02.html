            NIIT Limited is an Indian multinational skills and talent development corporation headquartered in Gurgaon,
            India. The company was set up in 1981 to help the nascent IT industry overcome its human resource
            challenges. NIIT offers training and development to individuals, enterprises and institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            On June 9, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Board of India concluded an investigation regarding insider
            trading within NIIT Technologies. The investigation verified that insider trading had occurred, as a result
            of a corporate announcement made on behalf of NIIT on the floor of the National Stock Exchange of India on
            March 23, 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2004, NIIT sectioned off its software business into an independent organization called NIIT Technologies
            Ltd. (Source: NASSCOM's 2013–14 Ranking of Top 20 IT services companies). In the area of training, NIIT
            launched its 'Edgeineers' program in 2005, to boost career opportunities for engineering graduates. In 2006,
            it diversified into various new sectors for training, such as banking, finance and insurance (through IFBI),
            executive management education (through NIIT Imperia brand), Professional Life Skills training and business
            process management training (through Evolv and NIIT Uniqua).

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            NIIT was established in 1981 by Rajendra S. Pawar and Vijay K. Thadani, graduates from IIT[4] Delhi, with
            one million rupees. NIIT conceived a franchising model in IT education for the very first time, setting up
            nine centers by 1987.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1986, NIIT began its foray into the software domain, beginning with Software Product Distribution under
            the 'Insoft' brand.[5] The company also began offering advice and consultancy to large corporations on how
            to leverage technology and make optimum use of their IT investments.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1988, NIIT introduced many marketing and advertising strategies for the Indian market including the
            'Computer drome' in 1990.[6] Another initiative launched by NIIT, was its Bhavishya Jyoti Scholarships
            program, launched in 1991,[7] which was targeted at deserving and socially challenged students with an aim
            to improve their skills and employability quotient.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1992, NIIT launched its flagship program GNIIT, an industry-endorsed course with a 12-month Professional
            Practice for students seeking careers in the IT and non-IT sectors. By 1993, the NIIT stock began trading on
            Indian stock exchanges. In 1996, NIIT began its globalization journey, setting up an education center in
            Hong Kong. In the same year, the company launched its virtual university 'NetVarsity'. In 1998, NIIT joined
            a handful of Indian tech companies to enter the Chinese market.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company earned the epithet, the 'McDonald's of the software business' by Far Eastern Economic Review in
            September, 2001.[8] The same year, NIIT launched an experiment that was christened 'Hole-in-the-Wall' by
            media and drew international attention. The experiment was based on the ‘minimally invasive education’
            methodology developed by NIIT R&D. It suggested that children, irrespective of their social, ethnic, or
            educational identity could learn to use computers by themselves, without adult intervention. In 2003, NIIT
            launched its MindChampions Academy (MCA) with Viswanathan Anand, five-time former World Chess champion and
            NIIT Brand Ambassador.
